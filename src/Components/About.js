     in the year 2021 and are bringing an innovative change to India’s education system by providing learning on 
     topics that are industry and technology-oriented and which helps the student to innovate with curiosity!.
      Our motto is to equip the students' community with the most advanced and innovative concepts in the Robotics,
       IoT & future technological Industry for Kids. This in turn would help the young generation of any developing
        countries on par with the top nations. QNOVATE labs was able to exhibit the most versatile building system
         using the technology Set. The Set helps to create and command robots that can walk, talk, think, and can
          do anything to the limit of human imagination. And the way to achieve this is to follow step-by-step
     instructions, which are very intuitive, and easy to follow: icon-based programming Qnovate Labs interface.

    Robots and technology are developing up to be an integral part of our society from having applications
     in industries to home applications. To make such innovations possible the world needs people who are driven
      by ideas and passion for technology. This Idea to create passionate minds led us to believe why not teach
       Student’s innovation and help them honor their ideas to create a better tomorrow. School kids from age
        10 to 16 standard are real fast learners and have the inquisitiveness towards technology, we saw this as
         an opportunity to provide schoolkids the proper knowledge and hands-on skills on robotics as an integrated
          subject in their schools so that they learn to invent and innovate right from a young age.
